# JavaScript Problem-Solving Task

This repository contains solutions to 10 beginner-friendly JavaScript problem-solving exercises.  
The goal is to use **plain JavaScript** (no frameworks or external libraries) and demonstrate problem-solving skills with functions, loops, conditionals, array methods, and string methods.  

---

## 📜 Rules & Guidelines
- Solve **all 10 problems** listed below.
- Pick **any 5 problems** and explain your solutions in a **5-minute video** (screen recording + voice-over).
- Use **only plain JavaScript**.
- Write your **own logic** – copying or AI-generated answers will lead to disqualification.
- Focus on **logic and explanation** more than perfect syntax.
- Upload your code in a **public GitHub repository**.
- Submit a **Google Drive link** (view access enabled) with your video explanation.

---

### Problem 9: Find the Factorial of a Number
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.  
**Example:**  
Input → `5`  
Output → `120`

---

### Problem 10: PingPong Challenge
Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 20:  
- Multiples of 3 → `"Ping"`  
- Multiples of 5 → `"Pong"`  
- Multiples of both 3 & 5 → `"PingPong"`  
- Otherwise → print the number  

**Example Output:**  
`1, 2, Ping, 4, Pong, Ping, 7, 8, Ping, Pong, 11, Ping, 13, 14, PingPong, 16 …`
